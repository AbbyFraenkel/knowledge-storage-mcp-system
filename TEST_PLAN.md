# Consolidation Testing Plan  
  
## Test Coverage Analysis  
  
The consolidated repository requires thorough testing to ensure functionality is preserved. 
  
## Testing Categories  
  
### 1. Unit Tests  
  
Existing tests found in `/tests` directory should be run and extended:  
  
```bash  
# Run existing tests  
pytest  
  
# Run with coverage to identify gaps  
pytest --cov=knowledge_storage_mcp  
``` 
  
### 2. Module-Specific Tests  
  
Additional tests needed for key modules:  
  
#### API Modules  
- Test `entities.py` CRUD operations  
- Test `relationships.py` connection functions  
- Test `queries.py` specialized academic queries  
  
#### Database Modules  
- Test `connection.py` Neo4j connectivity  
- Test `schema.py` validation methods  
  
#### Core Functionality  
- Test server initialization and routing  
- Test MCP protocol compliance 
  
## Integration with Merge Process  
  
Testing will be integrated into the merge workflow:  
  
1. **Pre-Merge Testing**:  
   - Run tests on both branches separately  
   - Document any failures for remediation  
  
2. **Merge Testing**:  
   - Create temporary merge branch for testing  
   - Resolve conflicts and run tests again  
   - Verify that all critical functionality passes  
  
3. **Post-Merge Verification**:  
   - Run full test suite on the merged branch  
   - Generate coverage report  
   - Create test summary for inclusion in pull request
